# stdioFrenz [Work in progress]
Sketching my personal site, I'm using this also to train and exploring new technologies and programming language in order <br>
to improve my skills.<br>


In this version, i've tried to use #jQuery to create animation and dynamic page changes.
I've also tried to create a one-page-site.
Hope You'll like this basic layout!
