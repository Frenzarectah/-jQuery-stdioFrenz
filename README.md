# stdioFrenz [Work in progress]
Sketching my personal site, I'm using this also to train and exploring new technologies and programming language in order <br>
to improve my skills.<br>


In this version, i've tried to use #jQuery to create animation and dynamic page changes.<br/>
I've also tried to create a one-page-site.<br/>
Hope You'll like this basic layout!<br/>

In order to notice my improvements, i was thinking to modify the layout only using #css-animations <br/>
with #keyframes method and pure #javascript to make the code more efficient.<br/>

Stay tuned! :)
