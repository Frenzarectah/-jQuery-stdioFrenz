Sketching my personal site, I'm using this also to train and exploring new technologies and programming language in order <br>
to improve my skills.

In this versione, i've tried to use #jQuery to create animation and dynamic page changes.
I've also tried to create a one-page-site.
Hope You'll like this basic layout!
